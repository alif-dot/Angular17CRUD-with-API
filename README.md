# Angular17CRUD-with-API

In this repository, I will create an Angular 17 (Javascript framework based on typescript ) web application using Angular's latest version.
We will perform Angular CRUD operations and for API we will use ASP.NET Core 8 (.NET 8)  to create a Web API from scratch.
This will be a great full-stack web application using two of the popular web framework ( Angular 17 and ASP.NET 8)
In our DotNET Core 8 Web API, we will use entity framework core and SQL Server to perform our CRUD operations .
We will create a new database from scratch with Code first approach using EF Core db migrations.
